# Summary of my Work on Imbalanced Data Handling Techniques
## 1. Techniques I've Explored:

### (a) Resampling Methods:

<b>Oversampling:</b> I've used techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset by increasing the number of minority class instances.<br>
<b>Undersampling:</b>You applied methods like NearMiss to reduce the number of majority class instances.<br>

### (b) Algorithmic Approaches:

<b>Cost-sensitive Learning:</b>  Implemented models that consider the cost of misclassifying each class differently, which is particularly useful in imbalanced datasets.<br>
<b>Ensemble Methods:  </b> I have experimented with techniques like Balanced Random Forest and EasyEnsemble to handle imbalance by using multiple models.<br>

### (c) Anomaly Detection:

Utilized anomaly detection techniques where minority classes are treated as anomalies, and models like One-Class SVM were employed to identify these anomalies.<br>

## 2. Outcomes Achieved:
<b>Improved Model Performance:</b>  Your techniques have led to a better balance in the datasets, resulting in improved metrics such as F1 score, precision, and recall, particularly for the minority class.<br>
<b>Enhanced Model Robustness:</b>  Models became more robust against the class imbalance, which is crucial in real-world scenarios where class distributions are rarely equal.<br>
<b>Understanding of Imbalanced Data Challenges:</b>  You gained significant insight into the issues and complexities associated with imbalanced datasets, equipping you to handle such challenges in future projects.<br>
