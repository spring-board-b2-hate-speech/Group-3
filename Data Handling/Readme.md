## Choosing the best method for handling imbalanced data involves systematic experimentation and evaluation. 

### 1. Define Evaluation Metrics
For imbalanced data, metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC are more informative than accuracy.<br>

<b>Precision:</b> The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions.<br>
<b>Recall:</b>  The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances.<br>
<b>F1-Score:</b>  The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.<br>
<b>AUC-ROC:</b>  The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.<br>

### 2. Implement Different Techniques
Implement multiple imbalance handling techniques. Below are some methods you can try:<br>

<b>Class Weighting:</b>  Adjusts weights in the loss function.<br>
<b>Oversampling: </b> Techniques like SMOTE and ADASYN.<br>
<b>Undersampling:</b>  Techniques like random undersampling.<br>
<b>Algorithmic Approaches:</b>  Methods like Balanced Random Forest or EasyEnsemble.<br>

### 3. Evaluate Performance
Evaluate each method using the chosen metrics. This involves:<br>

<b>Splitting the Data:</b> Use consistent train-test splits for fair comparison.<br>
<b>Training and Predicting: </b>Train the model with each technique and predict on the test set.<br>
<b>Calculating Metrics: </b>Calculate the evaluation metrics for each method.<br>

### 4. Selecting the Best Method
Compare the evaluation metrics across different techniques. <br>
The method with the best balance of high Recall, Precision, and F1-Score, along with a strong AUC-ROC, is typically preferred.
