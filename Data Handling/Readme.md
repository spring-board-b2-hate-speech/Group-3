## Choosing the best method for handling imbalanced data involves systematic experimentation and evaluation. 

### 1. Define Evaluation Metrics
For imbalanced data, metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC are more informative than accuracy.<br>

Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions.<br>
Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances.<br>
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.<br>
AUC-ROC: The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.<br>

### 2. Implement Different Techniques
Implement multiple imbalance handling techniques. Below are some methods you can try:<br>

Class Weighting: Adjusts weights in the loss function.<br>
Oversampling: Techniques like SMOTE and ADASYN.<br>
Undersampling: Techniques like random undersampling.<br>
Algorithmic Approaches: Methods like Balanced Random Forest or EasyEnsemble.<br>

### 3. Evaluate Performance
Evaluate each method using the chosen metrics. This involves:<br>

Splitting the Data: Use consistent train-test splits for fair comparison.<br>
Training and Predicting: Train the model with each technique and predict on the test set.<br>
Calculating Metrics: Calculate the evaluation metrics for each method.<br>

### 4. Selecting the Best Method
Compare the evaluation metrics across different techniques. <br>
The method with the best balance of high Recall, Precision, and F1-Score, along with a strong AUC-ROC, is typically preferred.
